#alle\_live-slacking started as a channel where we could report from conferences, workshops, seminars and so on in a “live-tweeting” style, which implies a more noisier channel. It has evolved though to a place where we often share in media res style images and so on. #alle is generally used for acknowledging birthdays, having more general and broad discussions or share something of interest for the whole company. While conceptually it perhaps could be the same channel, I believe it’s nice to have the possibility to mute #alle\_live-slacking if someone is on a roll :)
