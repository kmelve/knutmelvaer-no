You’re of course right in that most of these are applicable for development and projects in general. But, if I’d written this about Wordpress, most of the principles would be about how to remove stuff ;)

I believe the key to a successfull information architecture is when you manage to strike the overlapping between your client’s internal organization and the important user tasks of the site. I’ve mentioned it in other responses already, but [_The Core Model_](https://alistapart.com/article/the-core-model-designing-inside-out-for-better-results)  can be really helpful in this matter.

(also, must be nice to have Twig in Drupal now!)
