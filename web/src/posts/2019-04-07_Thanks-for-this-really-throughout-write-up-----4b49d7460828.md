Thanks for this really throughout write-up! üëè

Your plugin seems really cool, if you publish it on npm under the namespace `sanity-plugin-yourPluginName` others will be able to install it with `sanity install yourPluginName`. You‚Äôll also end up on [our plugin page](https://www.sanity.io/plugin) (you‚Äôll see that there‚Äôs markdown plugin there already, but that should discourage you if you enjoy making something of your own).

You wanted to add that you can also use our [Editor for Portable Text](https://www.sanity.io/docs/content-studio/what-you-need-to-know-about-block-text), and serialize the output to markdown. It‚Äôs really powerful stuff.

Here‚Äôs all our [blogposts](https://www.sanity.io/blog) serialized to markdown:

Looking forward to both seeing and reading about where you go with this project next!
