Title: Digital Humanities at Oxford Summer School 2016
Description: Having stumbled my way into the Digital Humanities, I have had to overcome an array of challenges when it comes to messy data, undocumented and buggy software, the rapid advancements in the tech-world and the scarcity of theorizing about what digital methods such as “distant reading” really tell us. In this session I will invite you to explore some of these issues and discuss how we can make DH more approachable with regards to theory and method.
