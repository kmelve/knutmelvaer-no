# Welcome to Remix!

- [Remix Docs](https://remix.run/docs)

## Vercel Setup

First you'll need the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli):

```sh
npm i -g vercel
```

Before you can run the app in development, you need to link this project to a new Vercel project on your account.

**It is important that you use a new project. If you try to link this project to an existing project (like a Next.js site) you will have problems.**

```sh
$ vercel link
```

Follow the prompts, and when it's done you should be able to get started.

## Development

You will be running two processes during development when using Vercel as your server.

- Your Vercel server in one
- The Remix development server in another

```sh
# in one tab
$ vercel dev

# in another
$ npm run dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!

If you'd rather run everything in a single tab, you can look at [concurrently](https://npm.im/concurrently) or similar tools to run both processes in one tab.

## Deploying

```sh
$ npm run build
# preview deployment
$ vercel

# production deployment
$ vercel --prod
```

### GitHub Automatic Deployments

For some reason the GitHub integration doesn't deploy the public folder. We're working with Vercel to figure this out.

For now, [you can set up a GitHub action with this config](https://gist.github.com/mcansh/91f8effda798b41bb373351fad217070) from our friend [@mcansh](https://github.com/mcansh).
