Thanks for some point-on questions [Harald Sævareid](https://medium.com/u/cb2c662907ec)!

1.  Slack grew pretty organically within the company and lived side-by-side with SocialCast for a while. When we decided to go with it exclusively, we tried to give everyone a good onboarding and wrote up some useful advice on our intranet (“here’s how you turn on automatic notification scheduling” etc.). We haven’t had those growing pains you mention as much, due to two things: (1) The channel structure, (2) The distribution of active users. The first means that we have enforced some channel-naming conventions, and the “obligatory” have a clear purpose and a touch more moderation. It’s also apparent that the activity is mostly distributed along the private project channels and the shared disciplinary channels (e.g. designers mostly talk in #fg\_design\_og\_id, frontenders mostly talk in #frontend). In the common #alle\_-channels, it seems that we have mostly a subset of vocal Netlifers who often take the oppertunity to comment, and the rest give their input mostly by emoji-reactions and so on. It’s not ideal for the diversity of discussion, but it reduces noise.
2.  Management was important in that the sub 15 Bergen office got to explore and use Slack as our primary communication platform in order to get some useful experience with it. It was also the management that asked for advice, but finally made the decision to adopt Slack and can SocialCast. In danger of being biased though, I think their main part was to get out of the way, but request some guidelines of how to structure it, and delegate some responsibility for keeping it sane.
3.  I agree with you, openness is important, but it’ll soon disappear in channel entropy. So we have tried to strike a balance here. The main reason client/project channels are private by default is to avoid a gigantic channel list (we have that many clients!). As a consultant house we also work with competing clients, and private channels are for their comfort, and to make it easier for us to make some virtual space between those who work for them. The culture of openness and sharing is nurtured though having channels for each discipline, but also in other ways (Pils & Proto every Friday, where we share something we work with and so on). We have also a culture of asking (_never sit longer than 15 minutes with a problem without asking someone_), which also prompts openness and sharing.
