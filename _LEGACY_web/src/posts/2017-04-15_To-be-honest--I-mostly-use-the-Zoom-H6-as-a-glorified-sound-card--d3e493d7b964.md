To be honest, I mostly use the Zoom H6 as a glorified sound card. That being said, it’s stellar for recording in the field, or recording up to six separate tracks. Neither of the included mics are designed for a single voice source though, both the MS (multi-sided) and XY records sound from several directions, which is awesome if you’re doing background textures for your documentary, but not if you just record your side of the conversation. So it requires you to have control over your environment to avoid reverb and echos. The SM58 is really a durable allrounder that costs you $99 (1000NOK) and will get you far better results and a recording that is easier to edit.
