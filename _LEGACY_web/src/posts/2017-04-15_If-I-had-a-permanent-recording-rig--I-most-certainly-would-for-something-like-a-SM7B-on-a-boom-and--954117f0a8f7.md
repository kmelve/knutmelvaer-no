If I had a permanent recording rig, I most certainly would for something like a SM7B on a boom and so on. It sounds that you indeed can tease out a decent vocal track with the Zoom mics, but the main reason I’m not recommending it, is because it’s also easier to screw up if you don’t know what you’re doing.
