It’s certainly a fine balance between too many and too few channels. We have prefixed all the important ones with #alle\_ to have them be listed hight in the channel list. The most important things is to vent and archive channels that’s rarely used and keep project/client-channels private (share insights and questions in disciplinary channels instead).
