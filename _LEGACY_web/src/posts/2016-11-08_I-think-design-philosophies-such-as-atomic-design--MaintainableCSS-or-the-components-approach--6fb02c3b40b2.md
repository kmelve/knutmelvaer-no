I think design philosophies such as atomic design, MaintainableCSS or the components-approach forced by e.g. React is way more didactic for designers and frontenders than frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation. The latter ones gives you _an answer_ to some recurrent problem, but not necessarily the right answer. More often than not, you’ll end up having to hack and override these frameworks, making the codebase messier and more unmaintainable. I have seen this so many times. The time saved initially will be spent further down the road.

The patterns emerging from those who actually care about and know CSS and how to make maintainable digital design systems is a better approach. In that it forces you to think through the problems beforehand. It makes you consider what you need, and not just all that you may have.

What you call “our own prideful pursuit”, I’d call “doing our damned work as designers”: Namely, solving problems through expertise and embedding our solutions in something that is maintainable and not bloated.

Ironically, the first time I really learned to think about my design system and my codebase, after just mindlessly defaulting to bootstrap and foundation for years, was with the… framework [Inuitt.css](https://github.com/inuitcss). It gives you some boundaries and out-of-the-box stuff, but is way less opinionated about how things should look and feel. So the world isn’t just $alert-color or $brand-color.
