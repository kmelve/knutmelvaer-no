I guess what I meant was “tabs”. [You can distribute your fields in a section along multiple tabs](https://craftcms.com/docs/fields#field-layouts). What we’ve found is that most clients overlook these (even when we make an effort to say that they’re there). So if we put fields in tabs, it’s usually things we set for the client, or fields that is populated from some integration or similar.
