ProseMirror and Oak seems pretty awesome! I’ve worked with a similar editor in a service called sanity.io for a while now, and it’s open sourced (the backend part is hosted though), and might perhaps be of interest to you [Ryan C Koch](https://medium.com/u/74b47f899d98)? I also wrote about it here: [https://hackernoon.com/headless-in-love-with-sanity-689960571dc](https://hackernoon.com/headless-in-love-with-sanity-689960571dc)
