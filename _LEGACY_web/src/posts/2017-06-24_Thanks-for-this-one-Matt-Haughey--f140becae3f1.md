Thanks for this one [Matt Haughey](https://medium.com/u/1445046f3fe9)! To my “relief” it resonated well with [how my](https://medium.com/netlife-research/how-netlife-research-uses-slack-518b877de8ce) bureau [figured out we should use Slack](https://medium.com/netlife-research/how-netlife-research-uses-slack-518b877de8ce).

It is also good to put [Slack](https://medium.com/u/26d90a99f605) in context of the whole range of internal communication of the team. For example, we quit sending the everyone@-email with important company-wide announcements, but allocated everything like this to its own channel. But there’s also files and documents we rather keep available on the intranett for easier findabilty. We’ve also begun looking at how we can work more strategically to stimulate fruitful inter- and intra-disciplinary conversations in Slack.

The main challenge is that many struggle with the sense of _inbox guilt,_ which makes for a bad cycle where the bar for participating gets higher. I’ve a hope that Highlights can solve that, but have found out that setting expectations™ and reminding people that Slack works best understood as a stream is perhaps most efficient. Sometimes is better just to ask the channel what has been going on for the time one has been away.
