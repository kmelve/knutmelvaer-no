Thanks for the writeup [James Mikrut](https://medium.com/u/76501b427d61)!

This is exactly why we at [sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) made [Portable Text](https://www.portabletext.org/), which we use in [our rich text editor](https://www.sanity.io/blog/introducing-the-new-editor-for-portable-text). In 2019 Rich Text should be typed and easy to serialize into whatever [markup language and framework](https://www.sanity.io/docs/what-you-need-to-know-about-block-text/presenting-block-text#serialization-tooling) you want to use it in.
